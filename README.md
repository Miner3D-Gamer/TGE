# tge - Text Game Engine


Originally made for displaying and creating console-based games but has evolved into a general-purpose library.

This library provides a wide range of functions and utilities for text-based game development, console operations,
data manipulation, conversions, math calculations, user interfaces, file operations, and more.

With a collection of over 800 functions, tge tries to simplify the development process and offers capabilities for
building text-based games, console applications, file manipulation, and various quality of life functions. (yay)

## Steps to installment until I make it more convenient:
1. Download the library as .zip (The green button at the top of the page -> 'Download ZIP')

2. Unzip the .zip into C:\Users\\{your username}\AppData\Local\Programs\Python\\{your python version}\Lib\site-packages

For me as example it would look like this when installed: C:\Users\Miner3D\AppData\Local\Programs\Python\Python311\Lib\site-packages\tge
